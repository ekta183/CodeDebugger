# 🚀 AutoCodeAI
AutoCodeAI is an AI-driven debugging and optimization tool that helps developers identify and fix bugs, improve performance, and follow best coding practices. Leveraging OpenAI’s GPT API (or other AI services) alongside static analysis tools, AutoFixAI streamlines the debugging process for multiple programming languages.
## 📖 Overview
-Goal: Provide real-time code error detection, optimization suggestions, and security checks for developers of all levels.
-Core Idea: Use AI (e.g., GPT-4) to analyze code snippets, highlight issues, and offer suggested fixes or improvements.
-Long-Term Vision: Integrate with IDEs (like VS Code) and CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for automated reviews.

## 🎯 Features
- 🐞 Real-time debugging
- 🔗 Multi-user collaboration
- 📂 Supports multiple programming languages

## 🛠️ Installation
